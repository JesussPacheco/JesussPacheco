# Hey, I'm Jes√∫s üëã

**Backend Engineer** building distributed systems and trying to write code that doesn't make future-me cry.

When I'm not debugging microservices, you'll find me playing guitar, hanging out with friends, or attempting to be a gym regular (emphasis on "attempting").

## What I Build

Backend systems that scale and don't fall apart when production hits. Distributed architectures, event-driven designs, and microservices that make sense.

My sweet spot: systems where performance matters and downtime isn't an option.

## Tech Stack

**Backend (where I live):**
- Java 17/21, Spring Boot, Spring WebFlux
- Microservices, REST APIs, Event-Driven Architecture
- Kafka, Redis
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure

**Frontend (enough to be useful):**
- React, TypeScript, Next.js
- Vue.js when needed

**Fundamentals:**
- Data Structures & Algorithms (Competitive Programming Background)
- System Design, DDD, Clean Architecture
- C++ for the tough stuff

## Currently

Still getting better at distributed systems, sharpening my Java + Spring skills, and learning from both startup chaos and enterprise structure. Always experimenting with something new on the side.

Open to connecting with other devs who enjoy solving hard problems and sharing war stories from production incidents.

## Let's Connect

Down to talk about architecture decisions, share debugging nightmares, or just swap memes.
